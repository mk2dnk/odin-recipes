    <H4>Ingredients</H4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Use paper towels to thoroughly pat-dry excess moisture 
            from fish fillets – this step is crucial for fish to 
            brown nicely in pan. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a bowl, combine melted butter, lemon juice and zest, 
            and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Stir to combine well. Taste and 
            add a bit more kosher salt, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 tsp kosher 
            salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black 
            pepper. Evenly press spice mixture onto all sides of fish 
            fillets.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large, heavy pan over medium high heat, heat up the 
            olive oil until hot. Once your oil is sizzling,  
            Cook 2 fish fillets at a time to avoid overcrowding 
            (allows for even browning.) Cook each side just until fish 
            becomes opaque, feels somewhat firm in the center, and is 
            browned – lightly drizzle some of the lemon butter sauce as 
            you cook, reserving the rest for serving. Take care not to 
            over-cook, as that will result in a tougher texture. Season 
            with extra kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve fish with with remaining lemon butter sauce, 
            basil or parsley, and lemon wedges.
        </li>
    </ol>
