        An Italian food menu just wouldnâ€™t be complete without

        Earth, Wind & Flour, other restaurants, and many 
        households across the world.

    <H4>Ingredients</H4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the grill for medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a shallow bowl, mix the mustard, honey, mayonnaise, 
            and steak sauce. Set aside a small amount of the honey 
            mustard sauce for basting, and dip the chicken into 
            the remaining sauce to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken over 
            indirect heat for 18 to 20 minutes, turning 
            occasionally, or until juices run clear. 
            Baste occasionally with the reserved sauce during 
            the last 10 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning!
        </li>
    </ol>
